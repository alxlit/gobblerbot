# Gobblerbot

It's a bot (of sorts) that works on [Gobblerpedia](http://gobblerpedia.org),
the student run Virginia Tech wiki. Really it's a single-worker task queue with
a minimal web interface. It's all rather hacked together to be honest.

  * It's written for Python 2.7
  * It requires:
    * [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)
    * [lxml](http://lxml.de/)
    * [mongodb](http://mongodb.org)
    * [pystache](https://github.com/defunkt/pystache)
    * [shovel](http://github.com/seomoz/shovel)
    * [wikitools](http://code.google.com/p/python-wikitools/)
  * Also note that some online resources that are only accessible to the
    Virginia Tech VPN.
